.SYNOPSIS
    Updates the deployed PriceChecker stack to the current images.

.DESCRIPTION
    Wraps the four steps an update needs, in the order they have to happen:

      1. Pull the images from the host. The app host cannot do this itself: DCP runs the docker CLI
         inside a container, and registry credentials are client-side (~/.docker/config.json, often
         behind a credential helper), so a pull from in there is anonymous and a private registry
         answers "error from registry: unauthorized".

      2. Stop the app host. It has to be down for step 3: DCP does not reconcile a container that
         disappears underneath it, so removing them while it runs simply leaves the app off until the
         app host is restarted anyway.

      3. Remove the api and web containers. They are ContainerLifetime.Persistent, which means DCP
         adopts them as they are on start-up and never re-examines the image. Skipping this leaves the
         previous build running while the dashboard reports everything healthy — the update silently
         does nothing. Removing them is the only thing that forces a recreate.

      4. Start the app host, which recreates both containers from the images pulled in step 1.

.PARAMETER EnvFile
    Env file passed to docker compose. Defaults to .env next to this script.

.PARAMETER SkipPull
    Skip the pull and recreate the containers from the images already on this machine. This is what you
    want after building images locally, where pulling would replace your build with the published one.
